\make cursor characters with - and |, just two dimensional
\make cursor blink



\tui:use term ,curtises or urwid or Own

\itui:ipython

\colors

\webui:svg,pyvg...

\ use nav characters s,S: s=+ S=-
 \ s:x,y,z
  \S:X,Y,Z
\ optional: use center character no nav
 \ like h
  \    y u
   \  g h j
    \  v b

\torus correction: 
 X=12
 x=45        #3*12 +9
 yc=int(X/x) #3
 x=x%X       #9
 y=yc+y%Y   

\also keep the negatives in mind.


\use spoints in istead of the named line funtions for x,y,z



\ types and order of displaying:
 \ layers:different grids
  \ p:previous
   \ c:current
    \ n:next
     \ m:meta, control and cursors,etc

\in show order layers, enable disable

\instead of layers:seti/add cell overlays

\read
 \  read from output into grid
  \ for easy re-editing and festing
   \   hexy draw -x 3 -y 3|hexy read -
    \  read:x=3
     \ read:y=3

\strip
